# AQI-Index-classification
This project uses a RandomForestClassifier trained on historical AQI data to predict air quality status (e.g., "Good," "Hazardous") from user-provided AQI values.

The app features:

1.Dynamic background images that change based on the predicted AQI status.

2.Interactive UI with a semi-transparent design for readability.

3.AQI reference guide (bottom-right) for quick lookup of AQI ranges.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
Real-time prediction: Enter an AQI value to get instant status feedback.

Visual cues: Background changes color/image based on air quality (e.g., green for "Good," red for "Hazardous").

Mobile-friendly: Responsive design with clear text contrast.

ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements
Integrate live AQI data from APIs (e.g., AirNow).

Add geolocation-based AQI lookup.

Forecast AQI trends using time-series models.
